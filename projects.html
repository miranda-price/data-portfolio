                <p>A good budget template should make distinctions between different sources of income and types of expenses to better track spending habits.  A Categories sheet was created to split finances into categories and subcategories.</p>

                    <div>

                <p>Each category has its own table that tracks the predicted amount, actual amount, and the difference between those two amounts for each subcategory.  The tables also have a row that calculates the subtotal of each measure for that particular category.  The difference column is automatically calculated, and its subtotal is highlighted green or red based on whether that category was on target or not for that month.</p>
                <h3 id="personal-budget-summary">Personal Budget Summary</h3>
                <img src="content/finance-tool-budget-summary.png" alt="Two excel tables breaking down the predicted, actual, and difference between predicted and actual values for income, expenses, and balance, as well as for the different expenses categories." height="250px">
                <p>The personal budget summary was designed to make it easy to track the money coming in and being spent for that month and give a breakdown of spending by category.  The summary also calculates the difference between the project totals and actual totals to suggest which categories need to be adjusted in the budget.  Important values like balance and the difference between expected and actual totals are colored green or red to give a good idea of the finances for the month without needing to carefully read each value.</p>
                <p>The first table of the personal budget summary compares the predicted and actual total income, total expenses, and balance, as well as the difference between the predicted and actual totals of each.  Cells in the difference row and balance column will appear green if the amount is at least $0 and red if the amount is in the negatives.</p>
                <p>The second table of the personal budget summary compares the predicted and actual totals for each category of expenses, as well as the difference between predicted and actual.  Cells in the difference column are red if in the negatives, and green if the amount is at least $0.</p>

                <p>The finances by month table tracks the actual income, expenses, and balance of each month.  There is also a column that shows how the running balance changes with time to track how much money has been saved or lost over a long period of time.</p>

                <p>The second visualization is a line graph of the running balance over the months.  The visualization also includes a trend line that forecasts the expected running total for the next two months.</p>

                <p>Based on this bar chart, Queens has the most trees and Brooklyn has the second highest number of trees.  Manhattan has the least number of trees, only a fifth of the number Queens has.  The Bronx and Staten Island both have more trees than Manhattan, but not nearly as many as Brooklyn.</p>

                <p>Based on the bar charts above, we can make some observations:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>The majority of trees are alive and in good health in every borough</li>
                <li>The proportion of live to dead trees is fairly consistent by borough, with the exception of Staten Island having a smaller percentage of dead trees and Queens having a slightly higher percentage of dead trees</li>
                <li>Staten Island and the Bronx have very few trees in poor health</li>

                <p>Tree age is measured by counting the rings on the stump, so tree stump diameter can be used to compare the age of trees.  Older trees would indicate healthier conditions for the trees over a long period of time.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Queens and Brooklyn have the largest tree stumps on average, indicating that the trees there are generally older</li>
                <li>Staten Island and the Bronx have the next largest tree stumps</li>
                <li>Manhattan has the smallest tree stumps, therefore the youngest trees</li>

                <p>Creating a scatter plot of average income of a borough compared to the number of trees reveals a negative relationship.  Plotting the line of the linear regression we can see that as income increases the number of trees decreases, however, we can also see that this line only fits three of the boroughs well and that Queens and the Bronx do not fit this model.</p>
                <h2 id="outliers">Outliers</h2>
                <p>The income box plot reveals outliers on the higher end for Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan.</p>
                <p>There is one observation in Manhattan with a value of $400K, which is $100K more than the next highest income.</p>
                <h2 id="findings-and-insights">Findings and Insights</h2>
                <p>There are tangible difference in the number of trees, and the health of trees to a lesser extent, between the different NYC boroughs.  There are also significant differences in average income and range of income for these boroughs.  </p>
                <p>However, these differences in income do not seem to the related to the difference in trees.  The borough most trees and the borough with the healthiest trees were in the mid-range of incomes and the borough with the fewest trees was the one with the highest income.  Plotting income and number of trees did not show any relationship, which was confirmed by the linear regression model only fitting three of the five boroughs.</p>

                <p>Further studies should examine factors besides income that may be related to the number and health of trees in NYC.  Population and area of the boroughs were not included in the datasets and could influence the number of trees more than income.</p>

                <li>Gender was limited to female students to avoid differences in the average height or the level of vegetarianism between male and female students affecting the findings.</li>
                <li>Age was limited to between 11 and 14 inclusive.  High school vegetarians could have become vegetarian after they were done growing so their vegetarianism would have no impact on height.  Grades 6-8 are also when many students experience growth spurts so the difference in height between the two groups would be more pronounced if vegetarianism is related to height.</li>

                <p>The average height of vegetarian students sampled was 156cm compared to an average height of 158cm for non-vegetarians.  However, our inference tests indicate that there is not enough evidence to conclude that this difference holds for the population as a whole.</p>
                <p>The confidence interval containing both positive and negative values indicates that the average height of middle school female vegetarians could be either shorter, taller, or the same as their non-vegetarian classmates.</p>
                <p><strong>In conclusion, the data does not indicate that a vegetarian diet has an impact on a child&#39;s growth, at least for female children between the ages of 11 and 14.</strong></p>
                <h2 id="future-studies">Future Studies</h2>
                <p>There are two obvious shortcomings to this study.  Firstly, there were significantly fewer vegetarian students than non-vegetarian students in our dataset.  Secondly, our study did not look at how long each student had been a vegetarian.  A student that has been vegetarian for a decade is more likely to have their height affected by the diet than a student that has only been a vegetarian for a year.  Further studies could take into account how long the student has been vegetarian and used a matched pair system to avoid these shortcomings. </p>
