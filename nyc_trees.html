            <h2 id="missing-data">Missing Data</h2>
            <p>A large number of observations have a stump diameter of 0 inches, regardless of health or status.  This suggests that the data is missing, so these observations will be eliminated for any analysis related to tree stump diameter to avoid skewing results.</p>
            <p>There were also several null values in the health column, which should be removed for analysis for the same reason as the stump diameter column.</p>
            <h2 id="visualize-data-relationships">Visualize Data Relationships</h2>
            <h3 id="income-by-location">Income by Location</h3>
            <p>We can compare the income of each borough by side-by-side box plots.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Manhattan has the highest average income as well as the highest incomes in general.</li>
            <li>The Bronx has the lowest average income and has some of the lowest incomes along with Brooklyn.</li>
            <li>Manhattan has the greatest spread of income, while Staten Island has a narrow range and has middle 50% of its observations within a $20k range</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Mapping the average income of each zip code supports these observations and lets us see how much income in each borough varies by neighborhood.</p>
            <h3 id="trees-by-location">Trees by Location</h3>
            <h4 id="number-of-trees">Number of Trees</h4>
            <p>Based on this bar chart, Queens has the most trees and Brooklyn has the second highest number of trees.  Manhattan has the least number of trees, only a fifth of the number Queens has.  The Bronx and Staten Island both have more trees than Manhattan, but not nearly as many as Brooklyn.</p>
            <p>Mapping the trees by zip code generally supports these findings, and also reveals that Staten Island has two areas with a large amount of trees and not many trees anywhere else.</p>
            <h4 id="health-of-trees">Health of Trees</h4>
            <p>Based on the following bar charts, we can make some observations:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The majority of trees are alive and in good health in every borough</li>
            <li>The proportion of live to dead trees is fairly consistent by borough, with the exception of Staten Island having a smaller percentage of dead trees and Queens having a slightly higher percentage of dead trees</li>
            <li>Staten Island and the Bronx have very few trees in poor health</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Tree age is measured by counting the rings on the stump, so tree stump diameter can be used to compare the age of trees.  Older trees would indicate healthier conditions for the trees over a long period of time.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Queens and Brooklyn have the largest tree stumps on average, indicating that the trees there are generally older</li>
            <li>Staten Island and the Bronx have the next largest tree stumps</li>
            <li>Manhattan has the smallest tree stumps, therefore the youngest trees</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="trees-and-income">Trees and Income</h3>
            <p>Creating a scatter plot of average income of a borough compared to the number of trees reveals a negative relationship.  Plotting the line of the linear regression we can see that as income increases the number of trees decreases, however, we can also see that this line only fits three of the boroughs well and that Queens and the Bronx do not fit this model.</p>
            <h2 id="outliers">Outliers</h2>
            <p>The income box plot reveals outliers on the higher end for Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan.</p>
            <p>There is one observation in Manhattan with a value of $400K, which is $100K more than the next highest income.</p>
            <h2 id="findings-and-insights">Findings and Insights</h2>
            <p>There are tangible difference in the number of trees, and the health of trees to a lesser extent, between the different NYC boroughs.  There are also significant differences in average income and range of income for these boroughs.  </p>
            <p>However, these differences in income do not seem to the related to the difference in trees.  The borough most trees and the borough with the healthiest trees were in the mid-range of incomes and the borough with the fewest trees was the one with the highest income.  Plotting income and number of trees did not show any relationship, which was confirmed by the linear regression model only fitting three of the five boroughs.</p>
            <h3 id="future-studies">Future Studies</h3>
            <p>Further studies should examine factors besides income that may be related to the number and health of trees in NYC.  Population and area of the boroughs were not included in the datasets and could influence the number of trees more than income.</p>
